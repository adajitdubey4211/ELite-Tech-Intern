Email Slicer
This script, Email Slicer, prompts the user to enter an email address, 
then extracts and displays the username and domain from the entered email. If the input doesn't contain the "@" symbol, 
it will prompt the user to enter a valid email address.

Features
Email Validation: Checks if the email contains the "@" symbol, ensuring basic validation.
Username Extraction: Extracts the part of the email before the "@" symbol.
Domain Extraction: Extracts the part of the email after the "@" symbol.


Output: The script will display:
Your username (the part before "@")
Your domain (the part after "@")
If an invalid email (without "@") is entered, the script will display a message prompting for a valid email address.
